• One of my first programs, made in 2017.

• I had made this program to perform a tedious task in an online adventure game which has some anti-macro systems in place.  The purpose of its completely random behaviour is to avoid detection by the game’s anti-macro systems.  

• Given a location on the user’s monitor, the program will begin automatically clicking in random parts of the area of a small disk centred at the location; it will also click in random intervals, move the cursor at a random speed to its new destination before clicking, depress and raise the left mouse-button at a random speed, and even hibernate for small random amounts of time; the location logic obeys geometric equations in a cartesian plane. 

•  I selected to present this relatively simple program to demonstrate that, for many years of my personal life, automating tasks with computer programming has been indispensable to the health of my wrists, regardless of those who wish carpal tunnel syndrome on them.
