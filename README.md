• One of my first programs.

• Given a location on the user’s monitor, the program will begin automatically clicking in random parts of the area of a small disk centred at the location; it will also click in random intervals, move the cursor at a random speed to its new destination before clicking, depress and raise the left mouse-button at a random speed, and even hibernate for small random amounts of time; the location logic obeys geometric equations in a cartesian plane. 

• Follow console instructions.  Press 'b' to begin, and 'q' to exit.
